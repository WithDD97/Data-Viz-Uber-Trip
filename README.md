Tableau Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/davidson.djani/viz/UberTripDataVizualizationTimeandWeatherEffect/Uberdatavizchallenge

For this project, the goal is to present insights into the uber trips dataset and the relation with weather elements and time. So we got Uber trip data for 5 drivers from April to June 2014 with *Time, geolocalisation for each trip, and the weather data from Wunderground* for the same period. **

We found out that :

- the traffic was between 3 cities :
    - New Jersey
    - Connecticut
    - New york
- **Thursdays** and **Fridays**, we got a  higher number of trips than the other day of the week

- Also, we also observe 2 peaks in the hoursâ€™ chart, one at 7 am and the other at 5 pm may be is when people go and back from work

- There is no relation between Temperature and the trips

- unlikely to the temperature, we can see a pattern between visibility and the number of trips. when we have a peak of visibility downwards, we observe a peak in the number of  trips upwards

- We also noticed that the day when we got the highest precipitation of the period, we also got the highest numbers of trips.
